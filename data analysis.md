1. Check out the .head() and .tail() of the data to get a sense of what they look like.
2. Check for nulls and decide how to handle them (Drop? Fill? With what?).
3. Check the data types of the columns using .dtypes() and adjust as necessary.
4. Remove any columns you're not interested in including and make sure the names of remaining columns are clear.
5. Get the summary statistics of the data using .describe().

Standard error
The standard error = standard deviation / sqrt (sample size)
It describes the dispersion of the sample statistic (such as mean)
around the population mean, giving you an idea whether more samples
are needed or not.

For a confidence interval, our z score multiplier is 1.96. The number 1.96 comes from a standard Normal distribution.
The area under the standard Normal distribution between -1.96 and +1.96 is 95%.
For 90% confidence, use 1.645.
For 99% confidence, use 2.576.

p value is the probability of a data distribution occurring naturally given the null hypothesis is true.

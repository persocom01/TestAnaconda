1. Check out the .head() and .tail() of the data to get a sense of what they look like.
2. Check for nulls and decide how to handle them (Drop? Fill? With what?).
3. Check the data types of the columns using .dtypes() and adjust as necessary.
4. Remove any columns you're not interested in including and make sure the names of remaining columns are clear.
5. Get the summary statistics of the data using .describe().

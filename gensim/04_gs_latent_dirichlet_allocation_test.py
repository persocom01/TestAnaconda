# Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is the most common topic modeling nlp
# technique. Topic modelling is an unsupervised learning approach in which the
# model identifies the topics by detecting the patterns such as words clusters.
# The outputs of a topic model are:
# 1. clusters of documents that the model has grouped based on topics
# 2. clusters of words (topics) that the model has used to infer the relations.

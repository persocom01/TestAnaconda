# A dataframe is a 2d data structure. Basically, a standard table.
import pandas as pd

# The dataframe constructor is as follows:
# pd.DataFrame(data, index, columns, dtype, copy=False)
# index being the row label and columns being the column label.
# They default to a range starting from 0 if no argument is passed.
